### Basics

This is a website using GH-Pages free hosting for projects.

This repository is designed to hold various projects for Viewing, Downloading, Contributing, and anything else you can do with projects.

### Repo-Structure

The repository is designed with **TWO BRANCHES IN MIND**. Here's how they work:

* MASTER BRANCH - This is the "Build" branch. Anything stored on the Master branch may be volatile, untested, and will be fresh-off-the-press builds. We cannot confirm that these builds are safe, nor can we say that these builds are functional. Anything stored here is COMPLETELY unsupported and Use-at-your-own-risk!

* GH-PAGES BRANCH - This is the "Live" branch. Anything stored on the gh-pages branch is stable, and is currently live to the server. This means that any file stored here is already being displayed on [our URL](www.brennanm.me). These builds are stable and supported, but we do not garuntee full functionality or stability.

### New here? Here's how to get my code.

There are several ways to download code from this repository.

+ **Downloading a release** - This is fairly straightforward. Simply download a pre-archived release of your flavor choice (Windows, Linux, Mac, super-compressed, etc), and then install it onto your computer.

+ **Using git (Mac/Linux)** - The preffered way to download my code **FOR NON WINDOWS USERS**. This quick guide will run you through the steps **assuming you are using a MacOSX or Linux machine (my demo Linux Distro is Ubuntu 14.1)**
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/brennan-macaig/mygithubpage.git # Will generate a folder mygithubpage in /Home, will initialize a GIT repository there, and then FETCH this repository.
```

+ **Using git (Windows - NOT RECOMMENDED)** - If you don't know how to use git on Windows, then please don't bother to read this section. I'm assuming that if you're downloading via Windows you already have Git installed, and I will not be going through the steps to install it. Instead, here's your clone URL: `https://github.com/brennan-macaig/mygithubpage.git`

+ **Some other way** - I'm sure there are other ways to do it. If you know of any that you like, please create a pull request! I'll add it right away.
