            <h2>Welcome!</h2>

            <p>Welcome to <strong>Just about anything you want to do with computers</strong>, where the title is pretty much self explanatory!</p>

            <p>Here in our artblock we'll be doing a lot of stuff. Here are some options I've thought about.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Programming</li>
                <li>Web Design</li>
                <li>Graphical Design (2D)</li>
                <li>Graphical Design (3D)</li>
                <li>Fixing the 3D printer</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Everything on this list is equally possible.</p>

            <h2>Structure</h2>

            <p>There are two ways this artblock will be structured. Here's one way...</p>

            <ol>
                <li><p>Arrive to the ArtBlock. </p></li>
                <li><p>Sit down at computer.</p></li>
                <li><p>If instructions page (like this one) is pulled up, read it at your own pace.</p></li>
                <li><p>Brennan or Richard adresses group on basics or unprovided information.</p></li>
                <li><p>Ask questions (if needed)</p></li>
                <li><p>Do work outlined by Brennan/Richard/Instructions</p></li>
            </ol>

            <p>And here's the other...</p>

            <ol>
                <li><p>Arrive to the ArtBlock</p></li>
                <li><p>Sit down at computer.</p></li>
                <li><p>Do whatever you were doing last time for working on your final project until you're told to stop, or     time is up, or you finish. <strong>If you weren't doing anything, ask Brennan / Richard for "final project" ideas.  </strong></p></li>
                <li><p>Listen to any further instructions if applicable.</p></li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Major Rules</h2>

            <ol>
                <li><p><strong>Absolutely no rough housing.</strong> Computers are <em>FRAGILE</em>, every part of them - from the monitor to the thing itself, heck, even the software.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>No bad language.</strong> If you can't say it with K-5th graders in the room, you can't say it here.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong><em>BE ON TIME, OR HAVE A REAL EXCUSE!</em></strong> I expect you to show up ON TIME to this Artblock. If you're 5 minutes late.... oh well, I suppose. If you're any more than ~5 minutes late, I'll shake my fists. If you're more than 10 minutes late, you'd better have a teachers note, or have someone come see Richard or myself. There is no reason you should be late.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Stay focused when working, and don't distract others.</strong> This means no misc. web browsing, no youtube videos, no funnies, etc. etc.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>No doing your homework or playing video games.</strong> This is an Artblock. Treat it like any other Artblock, not a study hall.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Don't shout.</strong> The computer lab is small. We can hear you just fine.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Try not to talk over others.</strong</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Work only as partners if directed to.</strong> Most of the stuff we do is individual.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Music is cool!</strong> This is one of the few "please do this" rules. Feel free to bring a device you can listen to music on if you have headphones. If everyone says OK, I'll bring a speaker and everyone can take turns playing a <strong>CLEAN</strong> playlist. </p></li>
            </ol>

            <p>That just about sums it up.</p>

            <h1>Today's Material</h1>

            <p>We'll be brainstorming other ideas, talking about the final project, and getting a "workflow" set up.</p>
