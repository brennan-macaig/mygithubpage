                            <p><strong>Welcome to my blog!</strong></p>
                            <p>This is the place I post stuff about my life! What I've been doing, how I'm doing it, etc.</p>
                            <p>Every now and then, you might even get to see something super special: me give a programming tip!</p>
                            <p>My blog is basically a place I can fill you in on my Independent Study, Artblock, or every day life!</p>
                            <p><strong>Please note that some of my articles will contain sarcasm, and most if not all are opinionated.</strong></p>

                        <p><strong>My blog and Website are oficially live!</strong></p>
                        <p>Yay! This took a lot longer than expected. Lots of things needed to get done, and finally, <strong>FINALLY</strong>it's done! My website is designed by myself, and since I used a lot of images it took me a long while to figure out how to get copyrights, etc., and now it's over! I'm freeee - nope. I've got to maintain it! *Long sigh*
                        </p>
                        <p>But hey, it was a lot of fun to make, and a huge learning experience. And maybe, JUST MAYBE, I'll switch it to a real server rather than GitHub. Pffft no.</p>

                        <p><strong>I'm pretty excited.</strong></p>
                        <p>I've started my independent study! WOOOHOOOO!</p>
                        <p>Today I worked on the final optimizations for the Artblocks pages. These pages took me a really really long time. You can get to them <a href="artblocks/">here.</a></p>
                        <p>Another thing I did is work on the 404 page (about time...). I figured out how to get that working as well, so that's a plus. 404 page is now in place, everything is good-to-go. That's a good feeling - updating everything *almost* perfectly on the first go. <a href="alhsdfhasjklhfjkahdfa.html">Try out the 404 page!</a></p>
                        <p><strong>Total time spent: 1 hour.</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>MORE NEWS! Tomorrow I'm going to be cloning an IDE drive to a "new" machine so that I can start work on the Artblocks Manager. Lets hope the source code is still decompiled.....</p>

        	      	<p><strong>Artblocks are going... WELL! YAY!</strong></p>
        	      	<p>That's a huge relief. I have 9 students (<strong>9!</strong>) and they all seem pretty excited.</p>
        	      	<p>That's why the "less errors" thing is here. It's exactly that. Days 1 & 2 have gone over well.</p>
        	      	<p>Time spent: 2 class periods + 1 hour.</p>
        	      	<p>Upnext! I'll be emailing Hillary after Richard and I meet on Thursday (move meeting to earlier for times sake) about accessing the machine.</p>
        	      	<p>Once we do so, I'll be deploying two small servers - one for my website and one for Hillary's service.
        	      	</p>
        	      	<p><strong>UPDATE!</strong> I've just downloaded CygWin on my Dad's home computer for use with making a Carrier Pigeon Email Distribution Server server, or "The Coop" for short.</p>

        	     	<p>I was installing Ubuntu to use the GCC command line (super useful, and since Carrier Pigeon's server is built for a Ubuntu server it makes sense to compile on the native OS...</p>
        	     	<p>and then it didn't work. So being me, I checked the harddrive for error and... oh crap. 34million read/write errors.</p>
        	     	<p>At least now we know why they use a long integer array for that number... people like me.</p>
        	     	<p>Replaced the harddrive, installed ubuntu, and now it works as intended... with Ubuntu.</p>
        	     	<p>I also built the carrier pigeon server and client git repo.... so there's that.</p>

        	     	<p>Oh well, I suppose. I'll just have to do it another way. Anyways, today I'll start work on the web-based front end and secure logins.</p>

        		<a href=""><h2>Mega Update 3/19/15 --> Now</h2></a>
        		<p>It's been more than a month since my last blog entry <strong>(YIKES!)</strong>, and since then a lot has happened.</p>
        		<p>Events Manager has been my main project, with a few things on the side (see other post: "harddrive drop test results soon"). During this time I have been very busy and not maintaining a blog.</p>
        		<p>Here are the updates that go along with my commit log, as far as I can tell.</p>
        		<p>(3/23/15) Worked on login database for user logins.</p>
        		<p>(3/24/15) Worked on login database and now PHP login handling.</p>
        		<p>(3/25/15) --> (4/10/15) Unknown exactly. I worked on almost everything. Got the login handling done, all the way through displaying a rudimentary table on the "events index".</p>
        		<p>(4/12/15) Created .htaccess, and created the .gitignore to help with streamlining the repository.</p>
        		<p>(4/13/15) Fixed the table on the "manager index", fixed variable names. Also changed a lot of things to match new .htaccess file.</p>
        		<p>(4/14/15) --> (4/18/15) Unknown exactly. Created the new "addEvent" files and promptly broke them. Fixed a lot of code "hot-fix" style (I should not do that anymore).</p>
        		<p>(4/19/15) Worked on removing a few stupidly created backup files. Fixed those from being created.</p>
        		<p>(4/20/15) -- (4/21/15) Working hotfixing this dumb two little errors that WONT GO AWAY.</p>
        		<p>(4/21/15) Made the create event / delete event work correctly. Yay!</p>
        		<p>(4/23/15) Added teacher creation... and it works!</p>
        		<p>(4/24/15) Added teacher deletion, confirmation modals, and teacher listing! Now time to easily port it to students....</p>
        		<p>(4/27/15) --> (5/21/15) Wow. Did a LOT of just..... straight out work. I mean, Im not very sure what to even say here. Created files, modified files... changed lots of things. Currently, I'm working on the sending in options system manually, then I can easily extend it to email, etc.</p>
