        <h1>Drama</h1>
        <p>I'm pretty interested in the arts, and I do a lot of acting. Over the course of the last two years I have had lead roles (more than one in some play) in three plays, all of which were large High School productions.</p>

      <h1><i>The Bug</i></h1>
      <p>In <i>The Bug</i>, I played David Rajeski. David loves to have a controlled life, and has worked his way to the top of the corporate offices. He is the only one who has ever seen the C.E.O., a mysterious Mr. Kropp - or has he? In this play exploring what can happen when there is a "glitch" in the system that is discovered; the entire office is left in ruins after a gun fight, and the three workers of the office are left questioning their own existance. This play had a total of 5 roles, 4 of whom were on stage.</p>

      <h1><i>The Caucasion Chalk Circle</i></h1>
      <p>In Bertolt Brecht's <i>The Caucasion Chalk Circle</i>, the "singer" (myself) tells the tale of a queen who - while wrapped up in her dresses - left her own baby behind when fleeing from a rebellion. A simple kitchen maid picks up the child and attempts to bring it to saftey and - of course, becomes the child's adopted mother. When the Queen demands that they bring the trial of who the real mother is before a judge, all does not go as planned. The local drunkard, Azdak (also myself) - who was appointed judge by two soldiers - decides to test who the true mother is by asking who can pull the child out of a small circle first. The real mother is that who refuses to harm the child, and justice is served to the Queen in the end.</p>
    <p>The <i>Chalk Circle</i> had over 52 roles being played by 16 actors. I had two leads, Azdak and "The Singer" (Narrator), as well as several minor parts (extras, old man #1, etc.).</p>

      <h1><i>The Canterbury Tales</i></h1>
      <p>The <i>Canterbury Tales</i> was a production of Geoffery Chaucers famous book of short stories or fables of sorts. In this story, 8 pilgrams decide to make a pilgramage to Canterbury, to ask for forgiveness. In order to make the time pass quickly, these pilgrams decide to tell short stories. Some are of virture, others are comedy, and some are tales of frivolity. The tales are all acted out, and three other people accompany the pilgrams in the telling of the tales. Although you never get to find out who wins to the contest of the best story, you do get to see the pilgrams arrive at their destination - Canterbury.</p>
      <p>Out of ten parts total, I played one of the 8 "leads", <i>The Pardoner</i>. I also had several roles in other skits, some large and others very small.</p>
