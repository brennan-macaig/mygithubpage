                <p><strong>I'm Brennan, and this coming semester I'm making a splash at CHS.</strong></p>
                <p>I'm a 16 year old sophmore who will be moving schools from Sant Bani to Concord High. In order for you to know what you're in for, I decided to make a portfolio of my past endevours into education.</p>
                <p>I started going to Sant Bani in Kindergarten, and have been going there ever since. During the course of my time there, I have done thousands of homework and classwork assignments, hundreds of large projects, and 11 huge projects-period projects. I have also completed over 50 hours of service, and have performed in two (soon to be three) major High School theater productions, and countless of minor productions in my elementary years.</p>
                <p><strong>I guess you could say I'm pretty busy.</strong></p>

                <p><strong>I'm an avid computer programmer and geek.</strong></p>
                <p>I started programming when I was 13, and haven't been able to keep my hands off the keyboard ever since. I started with a programming language called Java, and have since moved on to learn <strong>five</strong> other programming languages, including C, C++, Python and many more.</p>
                <p>I got my formal introduction to programming when I did my eigth grade Projects Period project on it, with Mr. Steve Olson as my mentor. Before this point, I was mainly self taught and didn't really know what I was doing.</p>
                <p>As soon as I got into High School, I took the only two computer science classes my current school had to offer. I took C/Objective-C with Mr. Steve Olson, and I took Raspberry Pi's and Robotics with Mr. Richard Danahy.</p>
                <p>After realizing I had expended my schools Computer Science department, and winning an award at the High School Awards Ceromony, I decided to take an Independent Study in Programming, a priviledge usually reserved for Juniors and Seniors.</p>

                <h2 class="sub-content-header">What is it?</h2>
                <p>Projects Period is done over a two week vacation at the end of Febuary and the begining of March.</p>
                <p>It is a 15-25 Hour long project (length depending on your grade), where the student gets to decide what they want to research.</p>
                <p>You can choose anything you want, as long as it gets approved in a formal proposal format by the Projects Period Comitee.</p>

                <h2 class="sub-content-header">Eighth Grade</h2>
                <p>In Eigth Grade, I worked on programming C and C++ for Projects Period. I was mentored by the fantastic Mr. Steve Olson, and boy did I learn a lot. I completed an entire course at Lynda.com on C++ (with some basic C thrown in), and became fluent with the base functions in C/C++. I still use my knowledge from this project to this day.</p>
                <hr id="sub-full-break">
                <h2 class="sub-content-header">Ninth Grade</h2>
                <p>In ninth grade, I built my own computer. I did around 25 hours of research on the full details of how a computer works; including full break downs on each individual part. At the end of all this, I built my very own computer that I still use as my main computer to this day. This project helped me around a lot with the hardware side of things in computer. I use this knowledge to help fix computers for people by knowing how each part functions, and what it's intended purpose is.</p>

                <h2 class="sub-content-header">Tenth Grade</h2>
                <p>In tenth grade, I created 3D animations and models using Blender3D. I created everything from <a class="inline" href="#">raindrops on a window</a> to things like <a class="inline" href="#">a roughly 1 minute long animation.</a> As with most of my projects periods, it was fully independent, so I utilized a lot of the internet's resources to guide me through the process. <a class="inline" href="/projectsperiod/">Here's a link to my entire presentation.</a> </p>
