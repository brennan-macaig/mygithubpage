Committees

I enjoyed being a large part of several committees at Sant Bani. These included the Student Council, the Dance Committee and the Discipline committee.

- Student council:
    Student council is a way for high school students at sant bani to get more of a say in the schools operations. Student Council allows each class to send a few representatives to meet and decide on things for the betterment of the high school. One of the things that we disscussed was the issue of the dress code - spescifically wearing "yoga pants". In the end we decided to make no change to the rule, but instead decided to make the rule more clear on why it was made, and the limitations of the rule. We also disscussed things like the cell phone policy at Sant Bani, and how homework assignments and projects were assigned.
    
- Dance Committee:
    As a member of the dance committee, my job was to help organize and set up for dances and prom. Not only that, but we also decided on how carnival week would work and what days would be included. As part of the dance committee, I DJ'd with a friend for both Prom and Semi-Formal (our only two dances due to time constraints), and I was very happy to be honored with this job.
    
- Discipline committee:
    Discipline committee looks at punishments assigned to students and evaluates the fairness of these punishments. The job of discipline committee is to make sure that punishments handed out are fair, and that students do get in trouble for things that they deserve to get in trouble for. Students on the discipline committee can give out demerits (punishment of sorts) to students who are not wearing indoor shoes, and can also take demerits away from any student that appeals to the committee.
